	<p> I am a Sports Management Sophomore at a <a href= "www.bju.edu"> Bob Jones University </a> who lives in Candler, North Carolina.
		I play basketball for the <ahref= "http://www.bjubruins.com/">BJU Bruins</a> and this will be my second year on the team. 
		My goal is to continue to play basketball after college maybe overseas or maybe in America, and then serve God in either basketball coaching, teaching kids, or 
		doing sports camps.I want to be able to serve God mainly and also show kids the gospel and love on kids, I love kids. Being 
		an athlete you automatically have a platform and are looked as a leader on campus, and you have to lead according to God. 
		<p> My other interests besides basketball is baseball I love baseball, and I also fish, fishing is really relaxing to me. 
			One other thing I love doing is just spending time with my family and friends. I also like watching sports and 
			learning the game of basketball, baseball, and other sports. I also love Christmas and spending quality time with
			the Family. I like reading history books, and learning about America when it was just becoming a country, I also 
			love movies dealing with sports or history. I love the founding fathers and what they stood for on political and 
			moral issues. </p>
